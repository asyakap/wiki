      <p>Brazza's martin (Phedinopsis brazzae) is a bird in the swallow family with grey-brown upperparts, black-streaked white underparts, and a brownish breast. The sexes are similar, but juveniles have more diffuse breast streaking. Its song is of a series of short notes of increasing frequency, followed by a complex buzz that is sometimes completed by a number of clicks. Its range lies within Angola, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Nesting in burrows in river banks, it lays a clutch of three white eggs. It feeds on flying insects, including termites, and may hunt over rivers or savanna. It forms mixed flocks with other swallows, but is identifiable by its combination of brown upperparts, streaked underparts, and square tail. This little-known bird appears to be common and widespread, and has been listed as a least-concern species since 2008. There may be some hunting of this martin for food, but it does not appear to be facing any serious short-term threats. (Full article...)</p>

      <p>Hip, Hip, Hurrah! is an oil-on-canvas painting from 1888 by the Danish painter Peder Severin Krøyer. The work shows various members of the Skagen Painters, a group of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish artists who formed a loose community in Skagen, at the northern tip of Jutland, in the 1880s and early 1890s. Krøyer began the painting in 1884 after a party at Michael Ancher's house, with the composition inspired by photographs taken at the celebration by the German artist Fritz Stoltenberg, although the individuals featured are not all the same. A dispute arose between Krøyer and Ancher the following day when the former returned uninvited to continue work on the piece, and although they reconciled Krøyer was not permitted to use Ancher's garden as the setting. The Swedish art collector Pontus Fürstenberg bought the painting before it was completed, and it was displayed at Charlottenborg in 1888. He later donated the work to the Gothenburg Museum of Art, where it has hung since.</p>
